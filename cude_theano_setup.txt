Stuff I had to do:
Follow all steps at least until section 6 in the cuda installation manual: http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/7.5/Prod/docs/sidebar/CUDA_Installation_Guide_Linux.pdf

You will probably run into issues when trying to compile the test sample scripts

Install MPI library, following http://lsi.ugr.es/~jmantas/pdp/ayuda/datos/instalaciones/Install_OpenMPI_en.pdf

Run sudo update-alternatives --config x86_64-linux-gnu_gl_conf and select the appropriate NVidia driver

Resolve any other issues that turn up when you try to compule the test sample script, since chances are those same scripts or similar functionality scripts will be run by theano




Try installing cuda from the .run file
pass the --override and no-open-gl (confirm actual arg) as mentioned in the install tutorial
